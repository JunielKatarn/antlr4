    <!-- =======================================================================
         A quickstart pom.xml that creates a sample project that uses ANTLR 4
         grammars. You should replace the sample grammars in src/main/antlr4
         with your own grammar files and use packages.

         A .g4 file in
          
            src/main/antlr4/com/temporalwave

          belongs in the package
          
            com.temporalwave

         See http://www.antlr.org/api/maven-plugin/latest for more details.

         This project produces both a jar file of the project and an executeable
         jar file that contains all the dependencies so you can run it standalone.
         See below for more details.

                    Build an uber-jar that is packaged with all the other dependencies,
                    such as the antlr-runtime and so on. This will be useful
                    for developers, who then do not need to download anything else or
                    remember that they need antlr.jar in their CLASSPATH and so
                    on.

                    You can delete this plugin of course and you will then
                    get a jar file with only the code generated and included
                    directly in this project. With this plugin though you will
                    find that when you build with:

                        mvn install

                    There will be an executable jar generated. You can run this as:

                        java -jar ${artifactId}-${version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar demosource.dmo

                    assuming you have a file called demosource.dmo to attempt a parse.
